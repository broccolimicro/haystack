# Haystack

Haystack is a collection of tools for the design and verification of
asynchronous circuits. Not all of the tools are complete. Below lists the state
of each tool:

 - [  2%] **chpsim** is a simulator for Communicating Hardware Processes.
 - [ 50%] **hseenc** finds state space conflicts and helps to fix them with state variable assignments.
 - [100%] **hseplot** renders state graphs, petri nets, and signal transition graphs.
 - [100%] **hsesim** is a simulator for Handshaking Expansions which can efficiently elaborate the whole state space of a circuit for input to hseenc.
 - [100%] **prsim** is a simulator for Production Rules.
 - [ 20%] **prsize** is an automatic sizing program for Production Rules.
