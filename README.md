# Haystack

Haystack is a collection of tools for the design and verification of
asynchronous circuits. Not all of the tools are complete. Below lists the state
of each tool:

 - [  2%] [**chpsim**](https://github.com/nbingham1/chpsim/) is a simulator for Communicating Hardware Processes.
 - [ 50%] [**hseenc**](https://github.com/nbingham1/hseenc/) finds state space conflicts and helps to fix them with state variable assignments.
 - [100%] [**hseplot**](https://github.com/nbingham1/hseplot/) renders state graphs, petri nets, and signal transition graphs.
 - [100%] [**hsesim**](https://github.com/nbingham1/hsesim/) is a simulator for Handshaking Expansions which can efficiently elaborate the whole state space of a circuit for input to hseenc.
 - [100%] [**prsim**](https://github.com/nbingham1/prsim/) is a simulator for Production Rules.
 - [100%] [**bubble**](https://github.com/nbingham1/bubble/) for bubble reshuffling Production Rules.
 - [ 80%] [**gated**](https://github.com/nbingham1/gated/) a simple logic synthesis tool to convert arithmetic expressions to boolean logic.
 - [ 20%] [**prsize**](https://github.com/nbingham1/prsize/) is an automatic sizing program for Production Rules.
